Although the project that was initially proposed is school administration software that would eliminate the need for staff members, parents and students of secondary and primary schools to use multiple programs or applications, developing this application is not feasible in the time frame.

Instead, we will only be producing the reporting module. This will include 3 distinct versions depending upon the users access level. The "views" that will be developed are a staff members, parents and students, and the necessary tools that would come along with those separate views. For example, a staff member would need to enter a student's marks for an assessment task.

The scope of this project will not include the financing module, which would include features such as payment of school fees by parents, or creating of purchase orders by staff members. We will also not initially include other modules such as the timetabling module, or an announcement module.
