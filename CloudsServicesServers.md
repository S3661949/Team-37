Clouds, Services and Servers

Clouds, services and servers are at the forefront of the IT industry right now. Some examples of major applications include Amazon Web Services  or AWS, Google Drive, Google Photos, Microsoft Azure and GitHub.

At a base level, cloud computing is the delivery of computing storage, power, applications, and other IT resources through a platform via the internet.

Currently, cloud services are used for many different applications, one of which is storage and access to files from any location connected to the internet. Dropbox and Google Drive / Photos currently do this, as well as GitHub.

There are quite a few benefits to be found in cloud computing compared to traditional, local computing.
