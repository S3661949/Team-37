The aim of the project is to create a reporting system that secondary and primary schools can use for staff members, students and parents. The reporting system should be clear, accurate and quick to use.

There are 2 goals for the project:

1. Creating the database, linking the database to CASES21 and presenting the information in a clear and concise way.

2. Creating the 3 separate views needed.

The creation of the database is relatively straightforward, and the clear priority for the project. Without the database there is no deliverable product, so our attention will initially be focused on this.

The separate views is where we will be able to stand out from other solutions. These views need to be extremely personalised for teachers, meaning tools like quick marking, easy viewing of whole classes, and filtering for different assessment tasks are important here. For non-staff, having secure data and only displaying the relevant data is the priority.
