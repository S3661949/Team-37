The project will create extremely usable reporting software. This aims to remove frustrations felt by all user groups of a school when accessing and using administration software.

By removing these frustrations, we aim to allow teachers to focus instead upon teaching content and helping students, rather than drag down performance with needlessly complex processes.

Removing hinderances found in software that is currently available will also allow students to easily view results and feedback, and instead focus energy on learning the material, while also allowing parents to not feel out of the loop when it comes to their child's progress.

We've decided to undertake this project due to frustrations felt by our own team members during school, and talking to current teachers who have to fill out these results and the feedback that comes along with it.

The completion of this project would show future employers that we are able to identify problems and bottlenecks within a workflow, and improve upon the current solution, highlighting our problem solving skills as well as our ability to collaborate and work with multiple people to achieve a positive outcome.

There aren't many alternatives currently available. Two major competitors are Compass Education, and Tassweb. What sets our product apart from these two, is our investment into usability and design. By designing our product to increase workflow and satisfaction in the user base, this product should perform in the market.
