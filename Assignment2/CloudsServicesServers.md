Clouds, Services and Servers

Clouds, services and servers are at the forefront of the IT industry right now. Some examples of major applications include Amazon Web Services  or AWS, Google Drive, Google Photos, Microsoft Azure and GitHub.

At a base level, cloud computing is the delivery of computing storage, power, applications, and other IT resources through a platform via the internet. There are 3 main types of cloud computing. IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service, provides access to networking features, data storage space and computers (whether virtual or on hardware). IaaS is most similar to existing IT resources that are available currentl.

PaaS is Platform as a Service. This removes the need for IT departments to manage IT infrastructure. It is a development and deployment environment. Like IaaS, PaaS includes infrastructure. However, it extends to development tools, middleware, database management, etc.

Finally, SaaS (Software as a Service) is a completed product, which is run and managed by the software provider. An example of SaaS is a web-based email where you can receive and send emails, while not needing to manage or maintain any servers or operating systems that the email program might run on.

Not unlike there being different types of cloud computing, there are also different models of deployment for cloud computing: A cloud deployment, hybrid or on-premises deployment.

A cloud deployment requires that the application is fully deployed in the cloud, and that all parts of the application also run in the cloud.

A hybrid deployment is a way for applications and infrastructure to connect between cloud-based resources and existing resources that aren't within the cloud. A common method of a hybrid deployment is extending existing on-premises infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to internal systems.

On-premises, or as its sometimes called, "private cloud", is a method wherein resources are deployed on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools. It doesn't offer many of the advantages that the other deployment methods offer, and is instead commonly used to supply dedicated resources to an organisation.

Currently, cloud services are used for many different applications. They can be used from anything and everything from hosting websites, hosting backups, to hosting virtual machines and ledgers for blockchain tech.

There are quite a few benefits to be found in cloud computing compared to traditional, local computing.

Cloud computing in its modern sense was first realised in 2006, when Google CEO Eric Schmidt used the term at a conferene. The main technologies that helped realise cloud computing as a viable concept were the advances in storage, networking and the Internet.

The advances in storage mean that hard disks have become cheaper, while also becoming more spacious. Network infrastructure advances allow for massive data traffic. The Internet is rather self explanatory, however we have seen and should continue to see increases in accessibility and decrease in price.

The cloud will impact a great deal of working industries and regular everyday living. The increases in services, infrastructure and software offered completely online without a physical presence required mean that remote job opportunities will continue to grow in numbers of employees, as well as locations. The cloud will also change the way people purchase applications and products related to technology for their personal lives.

We've already begun to see this, in the large increase in subscription based models such as Adobe Creative Cloud or Spotify. It should also change the needs of some IT roles in-house at organisations, with more options for outsourcing due to cloud based computing. This could vary from paying for storage space, to outsourcing entire IT departments.

However, all users of online applications will be affected by cloud computing, due to the way that it will change pricing structures for companies that are selling applications for use in people's personal lives. This has already been seen in the music industry. iTunes, which had one time purchases for songs which had to be downloaded onto the device you wished, was eventually overtaken by other music streaming services, and had to alter their business model. Again, this is an adjustment in payment structure to a subscription system and allowing users to stream music on their device.
