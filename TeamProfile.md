Team 37

Personal Information: <br/>
Amy: S3718266. I am Australian but love to travel and one of my favourite things to do is to go snowboarding. Since a young age I've wanted to study in the STEM fields. Throughout my secondary education, my passion for science and the prospect of learning the foundations of the future have inspired me to take my education further. During year 12 I studied computing: informatics. I would also say I have a keen interest in design and creating: applications, websites and artworks. In the future I would like to work with both the skills of logic and creativity. I do not have any previous IT job experience. <br/>

Esther: s3718706. I was born in Australia to Vietnamese immigrant parents. My hobbies include making watercolour art and watching youtube videos of derpy animals. I studied Computing Informatics for VCE. I'm interested in the UI/UX design and research industry. I have no IT related job experiences.<br/>

Jonathan: s3661949. I'm Australian, however my dad is German and my mum is Kiwi. I play basketball, video games
and read. I'm interested in System Administration, Software Development and DevOps. I worked in the IT department at
McKinnon Secondary College as an Intern in 2017. I also studied some IT subjects at secondary school. <br/>

James: s3724958. I'm Australian, my mother is Filipino and my father is English. My hobbies are health, fitness and drinking wine. I'm interested in cryptocurrency, data analysis & mining, cloud computing and app / web design. I've had exposure to multiple fields of IT through previous studies and freelance work, ranging from programming, databases, web development and design.

Group Processes: <br/>
Our group had a slow start in Assignment 2, however once we were all on the same page the group dynamic worked well. We were able to discuss ideas in a constructive environment, and everyone contributed positively.

However, our communication between group members was lacking. To improve for Assignment 3, we've decided to meet once a week outside of class and take minutes of the meetings, continue using our group chat and have also created a kanban board in Github.

Hopefully this will encourage more collaboration and discussion of ideas.

Career plans: <br/>

Amy: SCRUM master

Esther: UX Researcher

Jonathan: DevOps Engineer

James: Cloud Consultant

Amy's ideal job as a SCRUM master is centred around dynamic group management. Jonathan's ideal job of DevOps Engineer includes working with systems administration and software development. Esther's Ideal job as user experience researcher requires researching user attitudes and behaviours on products and systems.
And finally, James' ideal job of a cloud consultant involves working in different parts of the IT Industry ranging from cloud solutions, big data, analytics, infrastructure design / migration, development life cycles and machine learning.

Considering these different career paths it can be seen that all of group 37s dream jobs have a need for communication and crossover between a user or client to information that can be transformed to be useful.

Some differences between these jobs include the amount of back end work needed. Where Jonathans job clearly creates a solution to a problem, Esther's job requires more research to uncover potential problems to be solved. This is also in comparison to Amy's ideal job where understanding of backend work is required, however is more centred around communicating and delegation. More over, James' ideal job is similar to Amy's as a range of IT knowledge is required, however the focus is on the interaction between him and the client.
