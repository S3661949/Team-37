Personal Information: <br/>
Amy: S3718266. I am Australian but love to travel and one of my favourite things to do is to go snowboarding. Since a young age I've wanted to study in the STEM fields. Throughout my secondary education, my passion for science and the prospect of learning the foundations of the future have inspired me to take my education further. During year 12 I studied computing: informatics. I would also say I have a keen interest in design and creating: applications, websites and artworks. In the future I would like to work with both the skills of logic and creativity. I do not have any previous IT job experience. <br/>

Group Processes: <br/>
Our group had a slow start in Assignment 2, however once we were all on the same page the group dynamic worked well. We were able to discuss ideas in a constructive environment, and everyone contributed positively.

However, our communication between group members was lacking. To improve for Assignment 3, we've decided to meet once a week outside of class and take minutes of the meetings, continue using our group chat and have also created a kanban board in Github.

Hopefully this will encourage more collaboration and discussion of ideas.
