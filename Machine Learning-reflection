What does it do? 
Machine learning (ML) is capable of doing many things and it’s capabilities increase as it learns with time. It can learn to predict problems and future outcomes through recognising patterns in data. There are also several cases where machine learning is used for detection purposes. Moreover machine learning can also automate the data modelling processes so that data scientists don’t have to repeatedly run ML models, test and compare previous data models. 
ML is however still unable to solve complex business problems or clean data, a process of sorting data by eliminating bias, anomalies and corruption in data. A data scientist is responsible for cleaning and approving the data prior to it’s use in the the ML training or working process. 
The machine learning consists of a program to look at patterns in data. ML “learns” through it’s “training” by recognising patterns in large datasets that have been collected and tagged by humans which is fed into the computer. As it trains from exposure to more datasets, the accuracy of the prediction and recognition ability of the computer increases. When ML has to go through an evaluation, a brand new dataset is used to compare it’s growth in recognition and prediction rate to it’s training stages. A machine can “learn” to recognise an image of a cat by building algorithms based off of datasets of cat and non-cat images in order to train the machine to recognise or predict the right outcomes. 
Machine learning has already been used in some circumstances. The most basic is the detection of spam emails. Now there are more improved ML systems that are capable of detecting skin cancers and lesions almost as well as dermatologists. On a similar note, ML is also used for credit card fraud detection programs. Most recently MIT had developed a wearable “ computer interface that can transcribe words” called “AlterEgo” where users can motion the movements of speech internally (without the need to physically articulate words) to a computing device. It is worn around the ear with attachments to the jaw and part of the face. It uses electrode and bone-conduction to transmit vibrations to the devices which detects signals from the jaw and facial nerves to the computing device attached. It is an interactive device which can respond to the user when prompted and can also be used as an AI assistant. For example, in a chess game, the user can communicate with the “AlterEgo” by reporting the moves to it and the machine will suggest moves to the users. This device was created with the intention of creating a computer platform that can work together with human cognition, as if is were an extension of the brain.
In 2020, machine learning has the potential to be involved in many industries including health, communication and business. Machine Learning can become capable of detecting health problems like skin cancers as well as devise treatments which can increase the productivity of the medical visits and enhance overall human life. Many businesses may want to invest in using ML for automating repetitive tasks and and making analytical business predictions.

What is the likely impact?
People who work as drivers in the transport industry such as bus drivers, taxi drivers, delivery services, call centres may be made redundant by automated machines in the future. 
Driverless cars and buses have already been developed and are currently under trials in many countries. In the UK driverless shuttles have been trialled in Greenwich. With more autonomous vehicles especially in the realm of public transport efficiency and safety of daily commuters will increase as well as improving fuel efficiency and air quality in cities. 
Call centre companies are greatly benefitting from the use of machine learning for data analysis and improving customer experiences through faster decision making skills. ML is also able to detect a customer’s tone through analysis of voice and speech patterns and identity connection issues of slow line speeds or “no reception”. However for some call centre workers this means less human positions are available. Despite this, customers will be more satisfied with ML as it can quickly direct customers to the right person which reduces repeat calls from frustrated customers, being very efficient for the job.
The appeal of AI and ML outweighs that of human workers. Humans are prone to errors or having problems such as forgetfulness, inconsistency, bad health, laziness or mistakes. These problems can be overcome or at least minimised by replacing humans with automated machines.
In 2020 it is predicted that 2.3 million new jobs will be created although 1.8 million jobs will be eliminated; a predicted job growth of approximately 500,000 jobs. Many jobs may become obsolete in the future. This is most likely to happen to jobs with lower skill levels or less specialised jobs such as a factory workers, deliverers, drivers, call centre callers and package sorters. On the other hand, jobs in the IT field will increase especially with jobs related to big data such as data scientists, managers and analysts are said to increase by 28% according to IBM.
How will this affect you?
The difference will not be too drastic as AI/ML will not replace all human workers but it would most likely make tasks more convenient.The visit to the doctors may be faster and more efficient because ML can be used to quickly detect health problems. The doctor will then use most of the appointment time to give explanations of one’s heath conditions. Machine learning could also help people communicate with friends and family much faster on digital platforms where it can learn a user’s specific speech patterns and mannerisms to quickly predict conversations more accurately than today’s text detection and autocorrection. 
Some tasks may seem to undergo small changes. Machine learning in the future will provide driverless transport which would be used on a daily basis as so for millions of other Australians. Using public transport will not be any different as there is not much communication made with the driver in the first place. Overall ML will add convenience to everyday life but there may not be any significant changes that are amazingly life changing. 
Many of your friends and family may experience a similar future to you when ML technology becomes widely used in everyday products and services. They may find their experience to not be bombarded by ML as it’s applications to the real world won’t be very noticeable as it would be closely intertwined with our current technologies. ML would influence and be part of their lives without being actively conscious of its effects on their daily lives. If the descriptions above are said to be true, that people would be living a comfortable life without even thinking about the existence of ML, it would mean that ML is effective and beneficial for the future in terms of standards of living. However when looking at job prospects and opportunities with ML involved, some people may have a harder time getting into a low minimum wage part-time job or low skilled jobs if ML automated machines are fully implemented in the future.

Reflection
This group has been easy to co-operate and work with. Although we had a delayed start to the assignment, once everyone was assigned their tasks everything worked out. I may need to communicate more with the team and be more responsive. Other than that I think that the team is productive and hard working.
