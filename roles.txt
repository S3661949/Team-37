Roles
The roles are not clearly defined as “lead developer”, “technical designer” or  “user interface designer”within this group. The reason as to why there are no designated roles involved in this project is because all members are flexible workers who like to chose which parts of the project they would like to work on. This allows group members to work on areas that they are knowledgable in and improves the efficiency of the assignment.

Although there are no designated job roles, there is a group leader who oversees the group’s progress. The leader is the person who had the project idea, which would be reasonable as they would have the best understanding of what their project should be. As the project is about creating a good education reporting program, the rest of the group builds upon their ideas and works on tasks based on the project. The leader must communicate to the group about their project thoroughly to ensure that all members are aware of how tasks and requirements must be answered in relation to the project.

A KANBAN board is used to organise each members workload which makes it easy to read each member’s progress. Each group member is designated a section of the requirements to complete. Each member has a “card” which showed the progress of their workload or number of tasks to complete. When complete, the member can move the task over the the “complete card” to let other members know no longer needs to be worked on.
