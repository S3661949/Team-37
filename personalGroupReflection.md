*James:*

The group has worked together a lot better for this assessment than the last one. Having a set structure has really benefited everybody's productivity. Improvement could be seen in terms of preparation, potentially collaborating on more ideas and encouraging each other to contribute more. Definitely a great improvement through from everybody which was great to see.

*Jonathan:*

Having the entire group together at the beginning of this assignment, on top of having some prior experience because of last assignment really allowed us to work well together. We improved upon our preparation together, and the growth in dynamic between team members was definitely noticeable. The team definitely improved in this assignment.

*Esther*

Our group communication skills have improved since the last assignment which allowed us to work better together. There was an overall clearer view and understanding of our team members as well as the tasks needed to complete this assignment. This  enhanced collaboration enabled our team to be more productive and prepared with our work.
