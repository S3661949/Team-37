The group has worked together a lot better for this assessment than the last one. Having a set structure has really benefited everybody's productivity. Improvement could be seen in terms of preparation, potentially collaborating on more ideas and encouraging each other to contribute more. Definitely a great improvement through from everybody which was great to see.
