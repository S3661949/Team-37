has your opinion of your ideal job changed?:My opinion of my ideal job has altered slightly - a feeling of discouragement that this may be a lot harder than I thought. UX/UI designers are in much higher demand in the job market, many companies seem to not be as invested or be in much need of UX researchers. This means that I have to gain more skills than what is usually required from a UX researcher to really stand out for better job oppotunities in IT. <br>
