*Group Processes & Communication*

For this assessment we’ve laid out some clear guidelines and expectations for communication amongst the group. Most of our organising and aims for the week ahead are discussed during our weekly tutorials, we are also meeting once a fortnight outside of tutorial times to collaborate further and help each other on our individual roles and ensuring we’re all on the same page. All communication outside of tutorial and meeting times are in the dedicated group chat on Facebook where all members are expected to check frequently. 

*Testing*

Testing will occur over multiple phases, the first being with the design of the application itself. This will involve ensuring the interface engages, enables and empowers it’s users through the design. The second phase will be testing the application itself, checking for errors and ensuring the quality of the features and functionality.

Third phase will be testing it in a school, slowly introducing users starting from the admin and teachers and involving the students and parents in a later stage. Throughout this process it will be vital to seek feedback on all aspects to see what potential changes can be made.

We will know we have succeeded once the application is used in a school and all features will have worked as intended. Another criteria will be receiving mostly positive feedback from all user groups and having minimal errors across the board. From here it will be a matter of implementing the application into other schools and repeating from the third phase.

*Skills & Jobs*

The technical skills required for completing the project involve HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL and experience with CASES21. Other skills will involve teamwork, project management and QA. Dividing these into four roles / positions that could be hired for the completion of the application would see the following:

- Front end developer
- Back end developer
- Project Manager
- QA Analyst

The front and back end developers will have a bit of overlap as they will need to work closely together to ensure the application works as intended. The project manager will ensure the schedule and scope of the project and control communications within the team and to all stakeholders. The QA analyst will test the product to ensure the highest quality across all the features and specifications are met.

*Tools & Technologies*

For the front end of development revolving around design on the online portal, tools such as balsamiq and figma will be used. The coding itself (front and back end) will be done in Atom, using languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL. Hosting will be done on AWS to help with scalability in the future.
